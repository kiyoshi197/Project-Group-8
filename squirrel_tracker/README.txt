What is it?
This is a django based project which can help to track, add or modify the sightings of squirrels. In this 
project, user can view the sightings recorded by other users and check the details of different squirrels. 
Besides, the map view can plot the location of squirrels.

How it works?
In models.py, the class Sighting is defined and contain various attributes of squirrels. In views, we define 
functions for map, returning stats and showing data and details. In templates, there are html coding to 
depict how the websites look like.
